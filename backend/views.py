"""backend.views

General-purpose Django views for the `backend` app. This module contains
traditional (non-API) views used by server-rendered pages or simple
helper endpoints. API endpoints live in `backend.views.api_views`.

Keep this module minimal; prefer moving API logic into `views/api_views.py`.
